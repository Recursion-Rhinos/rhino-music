Take charge of your music experience. 

## Installing Dependencies
From within the root directory:

## Motivation
There are so many applications and websites these days that provide music related information. It can be exhausting to get the music news, events, songs, and music videos you need.
Wouldn't be nice if you had one account that provided all of these?
Sign up for Rhino Music and take charge of your music experience.
